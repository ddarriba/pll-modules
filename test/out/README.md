# Expected output for test cases

For each test case implemented in src/ directory, there must exist here an analogous
file named %.out (where the matching source is %.c) containing the expected output
for the test case.

When the expected output is set, the developer of the test case must ensure that the
results here are correct, validating the displayed results as required 
(e.g., comparing the output with PhyML, RAxML, PAML, etc)
